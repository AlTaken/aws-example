This repository uses an extract of data from the UN [Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO)](http://www.fao.org/home/en/) [Forest Resources Assessment](http://www.fao.org/forest-resources-assessment/explore-data/en/). In this report, published every 5 years, they collect and report country-level data on the state of the world's forests.
